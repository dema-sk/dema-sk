# About me👋

I am currently working at Camozzi Digital & Mechatronic Tuzla as a Software Developer, where I contribute to the development of intelligent automation and digital systems.I have a strong background in embedded programming and industrial automation, with hands-on experience in working with microcontrollers, sensors, and control systems.At the moment, I am expanding my skills in frontend and backend web development, aiming to bridge the gap between industrial automation and modern software technologies.
Outside of work, one of my hobbies is installing and maintaining air conditioning systems, which helps me stay connected to practical, hands-on engineering work.
I’m passionate about technology, continuous learning, and creating solutions that connect hardware and software in innovative ways.
